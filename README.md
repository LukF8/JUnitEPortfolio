## 1 JUnit
JUnit is an open source framework that has been designed for the purpose of writing and running tests in the java programming language. Origininally it was written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck. The goal of the framework is to accelerate programming and to increase the quality of code. It is one of a family of unit testing framework which is collectively known as XUnit.

## 2 Software Testing
A software test is a piece of code, which executes another piece of software. It validates if that code results in the expected state (state testing) or executes the expected sequence of events (behavior testing). This helps to verify that logic of a program is correct and creates a relation ship between developing and testing.

### 2.2 Advantages
Software unit tests help the developer to verify that the logic of the program is correct. Running tests automatically helps to identify software regressions in the source code. Having a high test coverage of your code allows you to continue developing features without having to perform lots of manual tests.
